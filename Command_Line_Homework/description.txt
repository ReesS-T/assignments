I pulled all expenditures for the category of "Food & Beverage" over $10,000. There were five occasions that the House charged over $10,000 for Food & Beverage, two of which occurred on the same day--November 15th, 2016, for the New Member Orientation. Additionally, the Office of the Speaker and the Office of the Minority Leader each had a charge of over $10,000 in this category. Those four expenses were split between two major caterers in the D.C. metro region, "Design Cuisine" and "Occasions Caterers." However, the fifth charge is unusual and bears further investigation: it is listed as an "Official Expense of Member," without further clarification to the Honorable Karen Bass, and the $11,957.63 was paid to Doubletree Los Angeles Westside, in Representative Bass's District. Fishy? I think yes!
