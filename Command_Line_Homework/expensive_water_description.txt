We began by creating and making executable a python program that imports data from a csv and looks for any expenditures on water of over $1,000. In this case, "filter" uses the STDIN from another command ("curl") that gathers the csv data of the House's spending from Q1 of 2017. After filter is executed, it produces a STDOUT which we redirected into expensive_water.csv. Finlly, we used the program csvstat to analyze the STDOUT of curl to find salient statistics from those expenditures.
